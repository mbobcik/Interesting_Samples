This is the visual studio solution for the code associated with the Computerphile videos on image filtering.

This code is written in C#, this is mainly because at the moment I code in C# a lot. Most people will have
access to a windows machine, if you don't own a copy of Visual Studio, Microsoft provide two free versions
in Express and Community editions, which I'd recommend. Installing these and running the solution should be
all you need to do.

If you literally can't find a windows machine, then feel free to port the code to your favourite language!
You'll need an image IO library that is suitable, OpenCV is one option, and supports a few languages.

One last tip: If you're unfamilar with Visual studio, it's worth knowing that the project in bold will be
the one that runs when you click run. You can run the other projects by right clicking and "Set as Startup
Project."
